## Project Description

This project involves analyzing the Market Saturation and Utilization State-County dataset from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The dataset includes:
- **Data Source**: CMS Market Saturation and Utilization State-County dataset
- **Number of Variables**: 49
- **Size of Dataset**: 1,044,711 rows

### Data Dictionary
The detailed data dictionary can be found [here](https://data.cms.gov/resources/market-saturation-utilization-state-county-data-dictionary).

### Questions and Hypotheses
- What patterns indicate potential fraud, waste, and abuse in healthcare services?
- How does market saturation correlate with inefficiencies in healthcare delivery?

### Analysis and Modeling
- Preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values and ensure data quality.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover initial insights.
- Building predictive models to detect potential FWA.
- Visualizing results using Tableau for better interpretability.

### Challenges
- Handling large datasets efficiently.
- Ensuring data quality and consistency.
- Selecting appropriate models and tuning hyperparameters.
